# Comprehensive Node.js Backend Tutorial

Welcome to the Comprehensive Node.js Backend Tutorial! This repository contains the code and resources for a step-by-step guide to building backend applications using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

## Description

This tutorial is designed for developers looking to learn or solidify their understanding of backend development with Node.js. Starting from the fundamentals of Node.js, we progressively build up to creating a full-fledged REST API with features like authentication, authorization, and database interactions.

We cover key concepts including:

- Core Node.js modules (File System, Events, OS, Path)
- NPM package management
- Building web servers
- Express.js framework fundamentals (Middleware, Routing)
- Designing REST APIs using the MVC pattern
- Authentication strategies (JWT)
- Role-based authorization (Admin, User etc.)
- Integrating with MongoDB using Mongoose (Data Modeling, CRUD operations)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster)
- A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- A REST client (e.g., [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/))
- Basic understanding of JavaScript is recommended.
- Familiarity with command-line basics.

## Project Structure & Chapters

The tutorial is divided into 15 chapters, each located in its own folder:

- **Chapter-01: Introduction** - Overview of Node.js and setting up the environment.
- **Chapter-02: Read and Write Files** - Working with the Node.js File System module.
- **Chapter-03: NPM Modules** - Understanding Node Package Manager and using external packages.
- **Chapter-04: Event Emitter** - Exploring Node.js events and the EventEmitter class.
- **Chapter-05: Build a Web Server** - Creating a basic HTTP server using Node.js core modules.
- **Chapter-06: Intro to Express JS framework** - Introduction to the Express.js framework for building web applications.
- **Chapter-07: Middleware** - Understanding and implementing Express middleware.
- **Chapter-08: Routing** - Defining routes and handling requests in Express.
- **Chapter-09: MVC REST API** - Structuring an application using the Model-View-Controller pattern for REST APIs.
- **Chapter-10: Authentication** - Implementing basic user authentication mechanisms.
- **Chapter-11: JWT Auth** - Securing APIs using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Chapter-12: User Roles | Authorization** - Adding role-based access control.
- **Chapter-13: Intro to MongoDB & Mongoose** - Introduction to NoSQL databases (MongoDB) and the Mongoose ODM.
- **Chapter-14: Mongoose Data Models** - Defining schemas and models with Mongoose.
- **Chapter-15: Async CRUD Operations** - Performing asynchronous Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with Mongoose.

Each chapter folder contains the relevant code examples discussed in that part of the tutorial.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific chapter:**
    ```bash
    cd Chapter-XX # Replace XX with the chapter number, e.g., Chapter-06
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Most chapters starting from Chapter-03 will have their own `package.json`)
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the code:**
    (Instructions might vary slightly per chapter)
    ```bash
    node server.js # or node app.js, etc.
    ```
5.  **Environment Variables:**
    Chapters dealing with databases or authentication (like Chapter-11 onwards) might require a `.env` file. Create one in the respective chapter's root directory and add the necessary variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`). Refer to the code or specific chapter instructions for required variables.
    Example `.env`:
    ```
    DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
    JWT_SECRET=yoursupersecretkey
    PORT=3500
    ```
